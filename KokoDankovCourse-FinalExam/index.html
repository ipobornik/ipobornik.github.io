                            <p>In Hive Keeper, you defend your hive from invading forces by raising an army of minions. The controls of the game may take some getting used to, as you do not directly control every action of your creature, and many of their behaviors will happen automatically. Your creatures will create a nest, feed themselves, sleep when they are exhausted, and perform other similar functions. Your role is to provide the resources they need to thrive. This is done primarily by constructing the different types of rooms for your minions. There are various types of units you’ll raise, and each has their own function. Drones are your main tool -- you’ll command them to dig out rooms, harvest minerals, spread creep, and rescue your warriors when they fall in battle – while Queens spend their time in the Psionic Nest researching new spells for your use. Aberrations toil in the Furnace and construct deadly traps to use in your hive’s defense.</p>

                            <p>Welcome to another Arcade Highlight. Today we are featuring the turn based tactical strategy game, Elite Agents. In Elite Agents you take control of a squad of three marines and attempt to outmaneuver and outthink your opponent, taking out his troops and capturing map objectives. You decide what kind of composition you deploy with, from the beefy ‘heavy’ class to the versatile ‘scout’. Game creator Trevor ‘Trieve’ Quach gives players with different playstyles the tools they need to dispatch their opponent as they see fit. If you like the idea of blasting apart several marines in one shot, the rocket launcher is the way to go. If you prefer finesse in your combat, flash grenades will be your tool of choice, disabling and blinding your enemy. The goal of the game is to earn points by eliminating marines, capturing the flag, and holding the hill. You can only move one marine at a time and each marine can only take a limited number of actions per turn. Moving, attacking, switching weapons -- everything deducts from your total action value, so planning ahead is a must for you squad to be the most effective. Welcome to another Arcade Highlight.
